# Craft Analysis

Scrapes through the websites of micro-breweries in southern Ontario to find their highest value brews in terms of mL of alcohol per dollar.

So far, the analysis includes:
- [Heartwood Farm](https://heartwoodfarm.ca)
- [Block Three Brewing](https://www.blockthreebrewing.com)

Note: These are all great small businesses and I highly recommend trying their products. They deliver to your door, often the same day you order!

Prereqs to run:
- Python 3.7+
- selenium (`pip3 install selenium`)
- a chromedriver installed in your home directory (I used [this one](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=80.0.3987.106/))

Then just run `python3 drinks.py` and you're off!
